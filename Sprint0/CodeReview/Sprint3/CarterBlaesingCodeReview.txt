Carter Blaesing code review. Reviewing Will's "StageManager.cs""

10/21

Sprint 3

One of the largest changes and improvements to our game was implemented completely by Will. He worked on the 
csv and drawing the dungeons, and specifically and notably our Stagemanager class, which calls different
classes within it like NextStageDecider and DungeonMap and the EnemyItemMap. It is quite simple and 
organized, and I had to understand it to refactor my link and enemy collision handling to be included in it.
I did this because Stagemanager tracks the stageindex, or what room of the dungeon you are in. This allowed 
me to only draw and detect collisions for hitboxes of enemies present in that specific room. DrawDungeon and 
the EnemyitemMap access different csv files fill of 0's and 1's and going forwards more numbers and 
translates them to blocks/items/enemies, drawing the appropriate in the correct spot. EnemyitemMap has a 
list of all enemies, which was important for me in drawing and detecting collisions for each enemy in that 
list. Will uses very clear names for variables and makes many separate files that speak to each other, which 
make his code very readable. Likewise, his code is maintainable, with variables that can be altered only 
once and not in each class that needs/ looks at it.
