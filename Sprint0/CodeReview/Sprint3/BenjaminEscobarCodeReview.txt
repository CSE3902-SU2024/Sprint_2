I think the Dragon.cs is readable as it not only has method names that explains what it does, such as MoveDragon and ShootFireball. 
There isn't exactly an order to the methods in terms of one part does movement while another part does collision, so in terms of that
it isn't as readable as it could be. The Update method can also be made more readable but I can fix that as I am trying to do collision,
and the collision part is the one that is commented out.
The variable names are readable as they all explain what they are being used for, without you having to go look at what they do.

I think in terms of quality the LinkEnemyCollision should be somewhat maintanable but it will require other methods added, as some of the
logic and methods used are not in the same file as LinkEnemyCollsion. There are also a lot of methods and variables within the file already
which can make it a bit harder to maintain.
A hypothetical change to the game would perhaps be adding either a different kind of enemy to the game, that doesn't work as similar
as the current enemies do, where we might have to add a differnet kind of collision entirely.
The current implementation maybe would not easily support that change as we made it this way as the enemies are similar, but it could work.
