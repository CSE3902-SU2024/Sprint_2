The Enemy_Item_Map.cs file is  readable.
The method names such as GetRoom, GetEnemiesInRoom, and Update are clear, easy to understand code.
Improvement:
The private fields _EnemyMap, rooms, roomHeight, roomWidth, _scale, _GraphicsDevice, and _ContentManager are named using underscores as prefixes.
Better to use camelCase for private fields, without the underscore prefix.

The methods GetEnemies() and GetRoom() throw an ArgumentOutOfRangeException if the roomNum parameter is out of range.
Better to include the valid range in the exception message to provide more context.
