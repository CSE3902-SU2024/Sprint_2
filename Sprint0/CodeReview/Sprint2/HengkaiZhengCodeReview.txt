 Readable: The class is well-organized, with clear distinctions between attackable and unattackable items via the `ItemType` enum. The comments describing item movement and frame switching add clarity to the behavior of the item.

 Readable : Variable names like `Position`, `Speed`, and `SourceRectangles` are intuitive and clearly describe their purpose within the code. The structure of the `Update()` and `Draw()` methods is straightforward and easy to follow.

 Not Readable : The use of "magic numbers" like `500f` for `MovementThreshold` and `4.0f` for `scale` is unclear without additional comments. These values should be defined as constants with meaningful names for better readability.

 Not Readable : The direct coupling of the `KeyboardController` within the `Update()` method reduces readability by introducing dependencies that could have been abstracted.

The Item.cs class effectively handles item movement, animation, and state management,
with a clear distinction between attackable and unattackable items using an enum.
However, it could benefit from improvements such as encapsulating fields like Sprite and SourceRectangles with properties,
removing unused imports, and adding null checks for SourceRectangles to avoid potential errors.
