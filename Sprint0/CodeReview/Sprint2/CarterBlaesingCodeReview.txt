Sprint 2

Enemy.cs

So this is the full developed code for sprint 2's functionality for the enemies of our game.
I like his logic and comments, and like the enemies with projectiles have their own Spritesheet load apart from the enemy myself.
My biggest complaint with his code is that enemy.cs over 400 lines long and contains large nested if statements for handling different logic.
I think for readability sake, like how I implemented my Link, each different enemy should likely have their own class file, following some sort of enemy implementation. 
Otherwise, his code makes sense with an easy naming scheme and the logic for his enemies works as wanted.
