Reviewing Item.cs

For starters looking at the top of the class, I don't believe it is neccesary for any of the objects to be public.
I also feel that each item should have its own class. There is not reason that the fire and heart should have the same class.
Finally having if else logic in the draw method is bad practice. I think this logic should be handled else where.
