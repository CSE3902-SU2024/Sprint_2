Carter Blaesing code review. Reviewing Will's "StageAnimator.cs""

11/11

Sprint 4

One of my favorite quality of life improvements to our game was implement by Will Koran and it was the StageAnimator class.
This class was designed to add a smooth camera transition between dungeon rooms, as if you were link walking through the door, 
rather than the previous instant teleport transition between rooms. Will's class is very readible. In this class, there is an 
'Animate' function which colllects the current room, next room, and notabily direction. This direction, along with an update class that uses
a constant offset for transition speed, is deterimined in the NextStateDecider class, which knows what direction you are heading based on what door
you go in. This class calls Animate, adding the smooth += offset from the StateAnimator in the correct direction. This gives a large extra
layer of depth in terms of feel for the dungeon traversing feeling of the game. This code is very maintainable, with an Offset variable rather than
a hardcoded number, meaning that just the variable can be altered to change the speed of the transition. Even though the desired speed has been found 
and set, it would be very easy to understand and make adjustments to his code accordingly.
