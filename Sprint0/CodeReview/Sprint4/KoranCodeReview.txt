William Koran Reviewing Triangle.cs by Cen GU

Right off the bat I noticed an issue with the scaling. Rather than parse the universal scale in from game.cs
you create your own scale value which is incorrect. This error will also affect the collisions of this item 
so it would be best to fix this soon. Other than that this file looks pretty solid. I'm assuming more efftects
will be added in the future as this is the Triforce and has special properties within the game.
