I think all the item classes are readable as there a few methods and variables for each and the only difference being what they do.
The code is nearly 100 lines but also spaced out so can see difference between methods, so will be easier to read and understand.
The differences should also be easier to figure out due to the naming of the classes and variables, as they all seem to explain
what they are used for.

The GameHUD class is maintable in that everything that it needs is in the class already. The class is also not really long which means
it will be easier to chance around to fit someone elses design somewhat though it is tailored to the Zelda's game HUD. There are quite 
a few variables inside the class however I think all are required and should be easily understood on what the function is.
A hyptothetical change to the game and class would be add another item onto the game HUD however I think think it will work as there already is
not that much space left to add anything along with the fact that it was already hard to make and update.
I dont think the current implementation would easily support the change however, maybe it can work but we would need to make everything already
in the game HUD smaller.
