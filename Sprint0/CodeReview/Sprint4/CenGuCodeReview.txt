Reviewing StartMenu.cs by Ben

The code efficiently handles essential start menu functions, including displaying the title screen, 
implementing a smooth text blinking effect, and integrating music playback. 
The choice to separate concerns¡ªlike drawing the menu and updating the timer for the blinking text¡ªis clear and logical, 
which makes the code easy to follow.
