To be honest I think that the Ak47.cs is not as readable as it could be as there are a lot of variables to keep track off, which could confuse people when
reading the file. There are only 3 functions so should be good in terms of readability. The variable names are also easy to understand in terms of what they are 
going to be used for in the file. The update function can be hard to read as there is a lot of layers to it, but should be ok.

In terms of quality, I dont think the wizzrobe will be easily maintanable as there are nuances to the file, that can be hard to copy though not impossible.
It doesnt call that many files and also isnt called that much which should make it more maintanable as there isnt a lot of stuff 
that needs to be changed if wizzrobe is changed.
The current implemeentation could handle a hypothethical change such as adding another guide, though making it move would be hard.
