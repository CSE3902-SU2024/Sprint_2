Code Review for Will's two player mode

The two player mode is a great addition to the game, and it adds a new level of excitement and competition.
The mode that allows two players to play simultaneously on the same screen.
There is few issue that two player mode that Link2 do not have its own class or script, it is just a copy of Link class.
It might cause some issue if we want further develop like get second players postion.(since they share the same heatlh)
It think it should be separated heatlh but could share the same inventory.
Two player also cause some buggy stuff like the chat box is not working perfectly in two player mode.
