Carter Blaesing code review. Reviewing Will's "TwoPlayerMode.cs""

12/4

Sprint 5

The largest addition to the game came from Will Koran in his addition of TwoPlayerMode. This two player mode is a gamestate that is called instead
of the single player gamestate if that option is selected in the initial load screen.The biggest noticable change to this mode was of course the
the second Link. Link2 is  just another instance of Link, and then a second stagemanager, gamehud, and mousecontroller are created and run just
like our previous single player game logic. Player 2 needed to be accomated for, in StageManager2 now called addition checks for the 
CollisionHandler, hitbox drawing, room switching logic, and more. DrawDungeon2 now accomated transitioning for link too aswell. Esentially, 
Will's addition of TwoPlayerMode created a different instance of our game, with of a lot of the same exisiting code. Small tweaks had to be made to 
almost everything to do existing checks or conditions that were for Link1, onto Link2 aswell. The only notable flaw of this two player mode is
that Link and Link2 share the same healthbar and inventory. For health at least, we weren't sure what should happen if one player died and the other
didn't. for the inventory, we didn't know how we would have enough space to have each player have a separate inventory. Since most of the code was
the same with just a copy for a second player, the code is very easy to understand. KeyboardController was modified to a big case switch block,
allowing for different controls based on what gamestate you were in, whether that be single play or 2 player or a pause menu etc. Lots of small 
bugs were found and patched with two player mode simply by forgetting to accomadate somewhere for the second player.
