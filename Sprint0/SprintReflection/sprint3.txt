The team worked well improving their Link game. 
Carter worked on Link and enemy collisions, handing the damage logic for each of the enemies and for link. 
These needed much refactoring as enemies were changed and how they were drawn changed. 
Cen gu worked on items, adding items to spawn like enemies in the items/ enemy map. 
They disappear once in contact with link. Ben eskobr worked on the blocks and enemy block collisions, and Will worked on drawing the dungeon.
Both Will and Ben worked to complete the csv file and logic for drawing and changing through the dungeon. 
Finally, Hengkai worked more on the enemies, changing how they are drawn in the dungeon.
Going forward to next sprite, we will again assign different necessary implementations to members and encourage each other to get the work done.
Some logic and bug testing from sprint 3 will continue to get fixed and sorted out as progress continues.
