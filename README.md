# Sprint 3 


## Movement
WASD or arrow keys for link movement

## Attacks :
- Z to attack with the sword in any direction. you cannot move until the sword has finished its attack.
- 1 to shoot an arrow in any direction. also cannot attack until finished. arrow breaks on impact
- 2 for boomerang. same logic. does not break on impact. hits enemies twice. 
- 3 for bomb. same logic. hitbox is only when the bomb explodes. 
- e to take damage


## Blocks & Items :
Items can be picked up.
k can be pressed when next to a door to enter the next room

## Enemies :
Monsters can be attacked and killed. most effectively with the sword. They will not respawn

## Misc:
q to quit

## Note:
You cannot walk through blocks. There is a small bit of wiggle room allowing 3 pixels of intersection
(makes it easier to move around through tight spaces). Monsters cannot walk through blocks (exception with the bat). The randomly change directions.
